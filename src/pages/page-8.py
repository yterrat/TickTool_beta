While it may not be feasible to install fencing around the entirety of your property, you could consider fencing off an area of the property that you use regularly. Doing this will also prevent deer from eating your plants and provides a safe space for pets to run. There are several ways you can reduce the risk of exposure to ticks on your property, such as installing fences and creating a mulch or gravel border around your yard. For more information, check [What can I do to reduce ticks in my yard?] (https://ticktool.etick.ca/what-can-i-do-to-reduce-ticks-in-my-yard/).
